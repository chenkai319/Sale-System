eclipse -> https://www.eclipse.org/

# SKills Needed

I have experience with java so it's easier for me to code this project. For those who are new to java, it very helpful to review the link I provided above to understand how java programming language is like before you start writing in eclipse. 

Here is the application's GUI. I want to keep simple and easy to use.
